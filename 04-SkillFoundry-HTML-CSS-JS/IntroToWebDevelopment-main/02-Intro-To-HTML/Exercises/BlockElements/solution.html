            <article>
                <p>
                    My name is Rikki Tomiko Ehrhart. I am an award winning student
                    leader and current Software Engineer Apprentice at Visa! I am
                    currently pursuing a Bachelors of Applied Science in Software
                    Development at Austin Community College (ACC).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am actively involved with WIT (Women Information Technology)
                    and Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society at ACC. I am equipped with 
                    a strong foundation in Web Programming, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>Swift</li>
                        <li>C++</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last semester I was the recipient of the Chancellor Student 
                    Achievement Award, which is the most prestigious award given
                    to a graduating student at ACC. I was also the founder and lead
                    instructor for the Grab A Byte Series, a lunchtime learning 
                    program I started with WIT in order to help myself and my fellow
                    WIT members become more comfortable with Algorithms. This next
                    semester, we will be learning GitHub.
