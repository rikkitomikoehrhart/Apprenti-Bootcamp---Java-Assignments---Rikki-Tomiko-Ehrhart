This is a Java-Based Airport Management System to manage flights, passengers, and ticket reservations.

## This project Includes:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Inheritance, Composition, Interfaces
- **File Handling**: Read and Write objects to a CSV file
- **Collections**: Using ```ArrayList``` and ```HashMap```
- **Date and Currency Handling**: ```LocalDate``` and ```BigDecimal```
- **Unit Testing**: Writing and executing JUnit test cases


## Expected System Behavior
1. Creating Flight and Passenger Objects
2. Adding Passengers to a Flight
3. Associating Flights with different Aircraft Types (Commercial or Private Jet)
4. Saving reservations to a CSV file
5. Running JUnit tests to validate functionality
