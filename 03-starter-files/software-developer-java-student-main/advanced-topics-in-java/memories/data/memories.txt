2~Uncle Sherwin~When you were two, you burned your finger and said you had an "owie minger". So cute.~true
3~Aunt Su~Maggie! My first memory of you is when you came to visit at Christmas with your Mom and Dad and the rest of our family. You were just a little kiddo.  We were opening gifts and everyone was saying “how cute”, “how nice”.  Later that night we were sitting around and you were looking at everything saying “how coot”.  A lot of time between that memory and my most recent, Thanksgiving in Florida- where everyone could see how beautiful, smart and loving you are. You’ve grown into such a great woman, with only great things ahead. Love you, sweet girl- congratulations on this milestone and KICKING ASS!~false
4~Jess~You loved to swim _so_ much.~true
